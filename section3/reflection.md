## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
	It felt more segmented, but all together more effective. Short breaks allowed me to get my fidgeting out of the way, and get back to it. 

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
	Sometimes I would get so involved, I couldn't step away per the Pomodoro technique. Other times I would spend too long away. I think it's going to take practice. 

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
	A hash is an unorganized list. Unlike an array it uses unique keysof any object type to index, for example: "petfood:200"

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
	pet_store[pet_food:200, pet_toys:35, pet_leashes:20]

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
	puts states["IA"]

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
	puts states.keys.inspect
	puts states.values.inspect

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
	A hash let's you mix data types of objects. A hash would be suited for a collection of objects regarding an email for example; You have a sender, drafts, replies, and subjects.
An array is an organized list, that's numbered, and is called by specific indexing of the position of that element. You can have an array of hashes, but you can't (easily) have a hash of arrays. 
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
	Nothing specific, just want more practice with them.
